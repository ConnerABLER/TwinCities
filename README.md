# TwinCities
TwinCities Application Project


Twin towns or sister cities are a form of legal and social agreement between towns [and] cities ... in geographically and politically distinct areas to promote cultural and commercial ties. The modern concept of town twinning, conceived after the Second World War in 1947, was intended to foster friendship and understanding between different cultures and between former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation and to encourage trade and tourism. In recent times, town twinning has increasingly been used to form strategic international business links between member cities.
This a group assignment with an individual component.
Working in groups of three to four students, your task in this assignment is to build a data driven web application that makes use of external API's and local data storage to encourage interest in twinning.
Except for Bristol, you should select a UK city or town and its twins (at least one other).
It is advisable to select a large city or town - as data about it and its twins will be more readily available.
Your application will use and display a range of data (maps, weather, images etc.); make use of a MySQL database; as well as implement various user interactions related to your selected city and its twin(s).
